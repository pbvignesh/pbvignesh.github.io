            <h2>Personal Notes/Materials</h2>
            <p>The below list is basically my own notes for things that I am studying about. They might be inaccurate/incomplete or just plain wrong. But I'll keep updating it as and when I learn more about the subject. If you notice any errors in the notes feel free to point them out to me. But <strong>DON'T</strong> use my notes as a tutorial, my knowledge on most things is zero so you're likely to break something if you follow my advice :)</p>
