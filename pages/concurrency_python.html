            <h1>Concurrency Programming in Python</h1>
            <p>I am going to use this as my reference : <a href="https://superfastpython.com/learning-paths/">Super Fast Python</a></p>
            <p>For a while now, I have been in situations where it is crucial for me to write fast python programs. It has come to the stage where sequential processing of instructions just won't cut it anymore, as a result I have started writing concurrent/parallel programs in python</p>
            <p>This page will contain my notes on writing parallel code in python</p>
            <p>When it comes to writing parallel code in python there are three main inter-related topics</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Concurrent Programming</li>
                <li>Parallel Programming</li>
                <li>Asynchronous Programming</li>
            </ul>
