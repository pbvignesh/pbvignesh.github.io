            <h1>Dunder Methods</h1>
            <p>Dunder methods (ie double underscore methods) are methods that are called implicitly by python for instances of a class based on certain scenarios. These methods are not called manually by the programmer though and sometimes feel like magic (hence called magic methods)</p>
            <p>One common example of a dunder method that is used often is the <code>__init__</code> method that is used for initializing an object</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    class Square:
                        def __init__(self, side_length):
                            self.side_length = side_length

                    square = Square(1)
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>In the above code even though the <code>__init__</code> method is not called it will be called implicity by python</p>
            <h2>Operator overloading with Dunder Methods</h2>
            <p>All python operators actually are implementing the dunder method internally. For example when we have code like <code>value in array_variable</code>, the <code>__contains__</code> dunder method is actually called</p>
            <p>In other words calling <code>value in array_variable</code> is the exact same as <code>value.__contains__(array_variable)</code></p>

            <p>So operator overloading is as easy as just implementing the dunder methods. There are many dunder methods like <code>__str__</code>, <code>__repr__</code>, <code>__new__</code> etc</p>

            <h2>Using __repr__ vs __str__</h2>
            <p><code>__repr__</code> and <code>__str__</code> are two dunder methods that are used to display information about the class to a human. Use <code>__repr__</code> to print detailed information about a class to the developer / programmer and use <code>__str__</code> to print basic information about the class to an end user.</p>
            <p>Ideally the output of a <code>__repr__</code> can be directly run in the python repl to create an object</p>
