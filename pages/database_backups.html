            <h1>Database Backups</h1>
            <p>Say you have a small website that is running on a small server. This website also stores data into a MySQL database and reads data from it. In case if this server goes down then your entire database goes down with it. If a website goes down you can always clone the website again but you cannot get the lost data. So how do we solve the problem of losing data ?</p>
